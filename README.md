# Scalable E-Commerce Platform

This is a scalable e-commerce platform project based on a microservices architecture, designed to create a robust, efficient, and maintainable solution for managing an online store.

The system is built using Java, Spring Boot, and Docker, following a microservices architecture that allows each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

The project follows the roadmap outlined in [Scalable E-Commerce Platform](https://roadmap.sh/projects/scalable-ecommerce-platform), which provides best practices and key steps for building an e-commerce platform using microservices.
